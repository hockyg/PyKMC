README.md
    This file, describing the overall contents of this code package
fileio
    This should contain utilities for writing and reading configurations and
        trajectories
lattice
    This should contain lattice definitions and tools for determining neighbor
        sites on that lattice
models
    This should contain rules for the dynamics, and code that builds the list
        of potential moves for the current configuration
tests
    This should contain scripts that run the code in known configurations to 
        check for expected results
